This is a simple e-commerce site created using Django. The site incorporates the functionalities of an e-commerce website like viewing products based on categories, product details, add to cart, view cart, and the checkout process. The site also allows viewing of orders after a successful checkout process. 

The project also implements custom User authentication and authorization through the Django Sessions framework.
